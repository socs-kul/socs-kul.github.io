# Preparing for Test 2
## Information
The second test will take place on December 20th. It serves to examine your understanding of all the material we have seen since the first test. This includes:

| Session 7  | Operating Systems |
| Session 8 | Linked Lists |
| Session 9 | Caches |
| Session 10 | Performance and Microarchitecture |

These four chapters have built upon the previous ones (sessions 1-5), which is why you still need to be familiar with the previous material. However, sessions 1 through 5 will not be explicitly asked in the test.

The first and second test contribute equally to your final grade for the exercises portion of SOCS. Refer to the ECTS course description for more information about how this course is graded.

The difficulty of the test will not be greater than the more difficult exercises from the exercise sessions. The test will take place on a computer, with a duration of 2 hours. You can access RARS and GCC, but you will not have internet access.

## Structure of this test
Test 2 will consist of three questions:

**Question 1**: A short question about caches, as seen in session 9. This should take *at most 20 minutes*.

**Question 2**: A short question about performance and microarchitectural awareness, as seen in session 10. This should take *at most 20 minutes*.

**Question 3**: A more difficult question about linked lists. We will check that your implementation gives the correct results and that you have respected the RISC-V calling conventions (see session 4). You will receive a simplified version of our test suite to test the validity of your own code. Note that if all tests in this simplified test suite pass, it is not guaranteed that you will receive the maximum grade. Try to create your own unit tests to check your implementation. This question should take *at most 1 hour*.
## Practice exam
To help you prepare for the first test, we have provided a practice exam. The format, difficulty and duration of the practice test are very similar to those of the real test, but the questions will obviously be different.

Here is the test suite for the third question: **---zet hier de testsuite---**

Aside from attempting the practice exam, you should redo as many exercises from the previous sessions as possible. These materials will be sufficient for you to pass the test with flying colors.

## Re-examination
The re-examination will take place in the third exam period. It will consist of only one test, and will cover the full material of the exercise sessions (1 through 11). The duration is 2 hours. The questions will have a format and difficulty similar to those of test 1 and 2.
