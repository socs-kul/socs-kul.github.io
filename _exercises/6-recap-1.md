# Preparing for Test 1
## Information
The first test will take place on November 8th. It serves to examine your understanding of all the material we have seen up until this point. This includes:

| Session 1  | Introduction to C  |
| Session 2 | Assembly basics |
| Session 3 | Advanced C & assembly |
| Session 4 | Functions and the stack |
| Session 5 | Dynamic memory |

The first and second test contribute equally to your final grade for the exercises portion of SOCS. Refer to the ECTS course description for more information about how this course is graded.

The difficulty of the test will not be greater than the more difficult exercises from the exercise sessions. The test will take place on a computer, with a duration of 2 hours. You can access RARS and GCC, but you will not have internet access.

## Practice exam
To help you prepare for the first test, we have provided a practice exam. The format, difficulty and duration of the practice test are very similar to those of the real test, but the questions will obviously be different.

Aside from attempting the practice exam, you should redo as many exercises from the previous sessions as possible. These materials will be sufficient for you to pass the test with flying colors.
